### Game/App Dev - Utility
Projects that I've worked on that are primarily meant to help with game or app development
Repo | Language | State | Summary
---- | -------- | ----- | -------
[Velentr.Font](https://github.com/vonderborch/Velentr.Font) | C# | Active | An alternative solution for Monogame/FNA/XNA-derived frameworks that utilizes SharpFont to draw text rather than the traditional SpriteFont approach, allowing the use of TTF/OTF files rather than SpriteFont files. I'm planning on doing some extensive reworks of this repo in the future
[Velentr.Input](https://github.com/vonderborch/Velentr.Input) | C# | Active | A solution for handling input better for Monogame/FNA/XNA-derived frameworks. I'm planning on refactoring this in the future to make it more easily maintainable
[Velentr.Localizations](https://github.com/vonderborch/Velentr.Localizations) | C# | Active | A simple and easy-to-use localization helper library
[Velentr.Collisions](https://github.com/vonderborch/Velentr.Collisions) | C# | Active | A simple collision detection helper library, not intended as a full physics engine 
[Velentr.Logging](https://github.com/vonderborch/Velentr.Logging) | C# | Active | A simple and easy-to-use logging helper library
[Velentr.Sprite](https://github.com/vonderborch/Velentr.Sprite) | C# | Active | A handy growing library of sprite/texture enhancements, including Texture Atlas packing and eventually scene graphs, amongst other things
[Velentr.Audio](https://github.com/vonderborch/Velentr.Audio) | C# | Active | A library for making interacting with audio easier. I'm planning on doing some extensive reworks of this repo in the future
[Velentr.UI](https://github.com/vonderborch/Velentr.UI) | C# | Active (Private Dev) | A project to make making simple UI's easier with Monogame/FNA/XNA-derived frameworks. Repo will be made public soon!

### Classwork (legacy)
I've uploaded all of my old classwork from college (retroactively) for posterity (and in some cases for my own reference). Not all of this still works as I've tried to remove any identifying info from it, in some cases through brute-force means that may make some projects no longer compile. Additionally, in some cases work has been lost. Please be gentle, there's also a lot of pretty bad programming practices in all this...you have been warned!
