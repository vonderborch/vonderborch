# My Personal Projects

## Latest Updates
2022/08/05:
- Added FnaUpdater to Apps section - a way to keep FNA up-to-date more easily
- Added SolutionCreator to Apps section - a way to create solution templates without relying on Visual Studio directly
- Further cleaned up this readme

- Big batch of new libraries I've been working on in spare time: Velentr.Debugging, Velentr.AbstractShapes, Velentr.Scaling, Velentr.Resolution
- Reorganized List to be alphabetical

## Possible Repo States
The possible states I'm defining for my repos:
| State | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| **Active** | Supported and up-to-date, no major breaking changes planned |
| **Active - Refactoring Planned** | Supported and up-to-date, but the code is messy and could be made cleaner to improve maintainability and/or perforamnce |
| **Active - Extensive Rework Planned** | Supported and up-to-date, but there may be breaking changes coming in the future (will try to limit these where possible!) |
| **Active - Unstable** | Don't rely on this repo! Things may shift out of it at a moment's notice as I see fit! |
| **Development** | Working on this developing this repo currently. Will be released soon(TM) |
| **Private** | Working on this primarily for myself, may release at some point if I can see a reason why (mostly listed here to keep myself organized!) |
| **Paused** | Work has paused on this repo, but I want to return to it at some point |
| **Up-To-Date with Base Repo** | Fork from another repo with minimal changes, key in-sync with changes in base repo |
| **Abandoned/Archived** | No longer supported. Code is as-is (and likely terrible!) |

## Games

Repo | Language | State | Summary
---- | -------- | ----- | -------
[CS323](https://github.com/vonderborch/CS323) | C# | Abandoned/Archived | A Bullet-Hell style game that was created for one of my classes in college (pretty rough code, but it did function and was pretty fun (balance aside)

Apps that I've created
Repo | Language | State | Summary
---- | -------- | ----- | -------
[ColumnCopier](https://github.com/vonderborch/ColumnCopier) | C# | Paused (rework desired) | A project to copy spreadsheet data (seperated by tabs, spaces, semi-colans, etc.) and display it in column format (and allow copying of single columns, etc.). Handy for working with databases

## Packages - Game-dev Focused
Projects that I've worked on that are primarily meant to help with game or app development.

The overarching "utility" name I'm using right now is [Velentr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_the_Smith). I've tried many times making games only to get bogged down reworking the engine so many times nothing ever happens. With my latest attempt, I'm trying something different by taking a page from micro-services and working on/packaging different components of the overall engine/framework separately. This way even if I have plans to rework things, the impact to other packages can be made relatively small...most of the time. Hopefully this will keep me more on track (unless I decide to switch entirely to UE5 :) ).

All of these repos are written in C#.

#### Notes
Due to the timespan some of these libaries have developed over, I can't guarentee they will all work together anymore, particularly any FNA flavored ones. Also _most_ of the packages have broken FNA nuget packages (only the most recent or recently updated ones have been fixed).

There is also plenty of code duplication and places where I have helper packages that I created _after_ releasing another package and now I need to go back and utilize the helper everywhere I can.

#### Packages/Repos
Repo | State | Summary
---- | ----- | -------
[Velentr.AbstractShapes](https://github.com/vonderborch/Velentr.AbstractShapes) | Active | Generic definitions for various shape definitions (Points, Rectangles, Dimensions, and Circles)
[Velentr.Audio](https://github.com/vonderborch/Velentr.Audio) | Active - Extensive Rework Planned | A library for making interacting with audio easier. I'm planning on doing some extensive reworks of this repo in the future since I don't particularly like how this turned out...
[Velentr.Collections](https://github.com/vonderborch/Velentr.Collections) | Active | A variety of helpful collections
[Velentr.Collisions](https://github.com/vonderborch/Velentr.Collisions) | Active - Extensive Rework Planned | A simple collision detection helper library, not intended as a full physics engine 
[Velentr.Debugging](https://github.com/vonderborch/Velentr.Debugging) | Active | A WIP library containing some useful helpers for code profiling, performance testing, and debugging

I'm planning on doing some extensive reworks of this repo in the future to remove dependencies on external DLLs
[Velentr.Input](https://github.com/vonderborch/Velentr.Input) | Active - Refactoring Planned | A solution for handling input better for Monogame/FNA/XNA-derived frameworks. I'm planning on refactoring this in the future to make it more easily maintainable

## Classwork (legacy)
I've uploaded all of my old classwork from college (retroactively) for posterity (and in some cases for my own reference). Not all of this still works as I've tried to remove any identifying info from it, in some cases through brute-force means that may make some projects no longer compile. Additionally, in some cases work has been lost. Please be gentle, there's also a lot of pretty bad programming practices in all this...you have been warned!
