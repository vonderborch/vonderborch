# My Personal Projects
A comprehensive listing of all of my public repos.

### Game Dev
Projects that I've worked on related to GameDev stuff

Repo | Language | State | Summary

[BragiFont](https://github.com/vonderborch/BragiFont) | C# | Active | An alternative solution for Monogame/FNA/XNA-derived frameworks that utilizes SharpFont to draw text rather than the traditional SpriteFont approach, allowing the use of TTF/OTF files rather than SpriteFont files

### Utility
These are small projects that I wrote to help out with some basic task.
Repo | Language | State | Summary
---- | -------- | ----- | -------
[FolderSync](https://github.com/vonderborch/FolderSync) | C# | Abandoned | A project to keep two files in a source destination synced with a destination destination
[ColumnCopier](https://github.com/vonderborch/ColumnCopier) | C# | Paused (rework desired) | A project to copy spreadsheet data (seperated by tabs, spaces, semi-colans, etc.) and display it in column format (and allow copying of single columns, etc.). Handy for working with databases.
[PclSystemInfo](https://github.com/vonderborch/PclSystemInfo) | C# | Abandoned | A project to gather a variety of system information (processor count, ram amount, etc.) in a cross-platform way using PCL's
[PclNumberConverters](https://github.com/vonderborch/PclNumberConverters) | C# | Abandoned | A project to allow conversion between a variety of different measurement systems in a cross-platform way using PCL's
[FenrirFS](https://github.com/vonderborch/FenrirFS) | C# | Abandoned | A project to allow for consistent cross-platform file system access using PCL's. Abandoned due to similar stuff in .NET Standard
[SharpFont](https://github.com/vonderborch/SharpFont) | C# | Up-To-Date with Base Repo | A fork of [Robmaister's SharpFont](https://github.com/Robmaister/SharpFont) that builds on the work to allow the library to be used with .NET Standard

### Classwork (legacy)
I've uploaded all of my old classwork from college (retroactively) for posterity (and in some cases for my own reference). Not all of this still works as I've tried to remove any identifying info from it, in some cases through brute-force means that may make some projects no longer compile. Additionally, in some cases work has been lost. Please be gentle, there's also a lot of pretty bad programming practices in all this...you have been warned!
